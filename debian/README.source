Content of source package
=========================

"openjdk-8" is a composite source package:
- Multiple tarballs from each Oracle mercurial repositories :
  corba / hotspot / jaxp / jaxws / jdk-dfsg / langtools / openjdk
  including Nashorn
- IcedTea sound support
- Debian packaging scripts and patches.

Building a new OpenJDK-8 Debian package
=======================================

Use debian/rules get-orig to download the new upstream sources
after adjusting hg_tag etc. in debian/rules to point to the
desired upstream versions and tags.

Support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
=============================

As described in Debian Policy §4.9.1, current package's debian/rules support
the standardised environment variable DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. This variable can
contain several flags to change how a package is compiled and built.

  * nocheck: don't run jtreg test suites.
  * nodocs: pass --disable-docs to IcedTea configure script, which
            disable Javadoc generation.
  * nostrip: debugging symbols should not be stripped from the
             binary during installation
  * parallel=X: package should be built using up to X parallel processes
  * noaltzero: don't build alternative Zero VM.
  * noaltshark: don't build alternative Shark VM.

Sample usage:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=5 nocheck" debuild -i"(\.hg|\.bzr)"

 Build with 5 parallel processes and don't run jtreg test suites.

This also work with cowbuilder/pbuilder:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=5 nocheck" pdebuild -i"(\.hg|\.bzr)" --logfile ../build.log --pbuilder cowbuilder

Test failures
=============

In older releases (stretch, xenial, and anything before), it is
often not worth the delay to run the tests at all. Reasons for
test failures are:

• jasm, jcoder, etc. missing: there is no Debian package for
  https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/asmtools
  at all, despite jtreg officially depending on it (all releases)

• jtreg doesn’t know @comment which is used in some tests (old releases)

• java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/primitives/Ints
  in testng (old releases)

If this wasn’t in maintenance mode I’d suggest packaging asmtools,
probably with /usr/bin/jasm and friends, B-Ding on it for sid,
testing the hell out of this for sid, rebuild the same code for
older releases hoping/praying things will work there. Perhaps even
fixing testng plus backporting @comment to jtreg…?

But, as things are, best to ignore all test failures and assume(…)
upstream know what they do :/
